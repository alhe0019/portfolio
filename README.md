I started coding with the html structure of the pages Before styling them.
I staged, committed, and synched the code to GitHub repo.
I started syling page by page always checking the styling with live server on the browser

The challenges that i faced were making the layout responsive for moble and desktop screens
I solved this challenges by using the media quries for the dektop layout

I have learned how to design a website from scratch using the sticky notes to the high fidelity wireframes using Adobe XD program and how to convert and develop this design in HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code editor.

I only used my own graphics and photos. I have used Font Awsowme for the icons.
